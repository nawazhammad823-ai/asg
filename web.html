    <font size="6">MY name is hammad. I am a dedicated and motivated student from kashmir,Currently i live in rawalpindi,its a beautiful city,
    where I built a strong academic foundation, and later completed my intermediate education from the Federal Board Islamabad.
     Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) at the Barani Institute of Information Technology (BIIT).
     I have a strong interest in coding and enjoy solving problems through programming, which has helped me develop logical thinking and technical skills.
     I am also highly interested in Artificial Intelligence and eager to explore how modern technologies can shape the future and solve real-world problems.
    Along with academics, I have a keen interest in sports, which help me stay active, disciplined, and mentally refreshed.  I believe in hard work, 
    consistency, and continuous learning, and I aim to become a skilled computer science professional who can contribute positively to society while 
    proudly representing my region.
